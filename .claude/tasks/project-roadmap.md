## 📝 How We Work

### Starting a New Feature
1. **Pick a task** from the Future Enhancements
2. **Break it down** into smaller, manageable pieces
3. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name
4. **Work incrementally** - small commits, test often
5. **Ask for feedback** early and often

### Our Development Philosophy
- **Keep it Simple** - The best code is code that's easy to understand
- **Think of the User** - Every feature should make someone's life easier
- **Test Everything** - If it's not tested, it's broken
- **Document as You Go** - Future you will thank present you
- **Have Fun!** - We're building something cool together

## 💬 Notes & Ideas

### Random Thoughts
- What if we could import collections directly from a URL?
- Could we add a "collection marketplace" for sharing tests?
- Integration with popular API documentation tools?
- Mobile app for monitoring tests on the go?

### Technical Debt
- Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Optimize bundle size for faster initial load
- Consider using a message queue for long-running tests
