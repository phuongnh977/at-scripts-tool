## Review Section

### Latest Changes Summary (SPA Migration)
- **Separated Frontend/Backend Architecture**
  - Created standalone Vue 3 SPA in `frontend/` directory
  - Moved all backend code to `backend/` directory
  - Removed EJS templating, converted to pure REST API

- **Frontend Implementation**
  - Set up Vue 3 with Vite for fast development
  - Implemented Vue Router for client-side routing
  - Created service layer for API communication
  - Migrated all views to Vue components
  - Configured proxy for development

- **Backend Changes**
  - Removed all view rendering code
  - Focused on REST API endpoints only
  - Added health check endpoint
  - Improved error handling

- **Development Experience**
  - Added concurrent running of frontend/backend
  - Separate package.json for better dependency management
  - Hot module replacement for frontend development

### Technical Decisions
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: More flexible and TypeScript-ready
- **Vite**: Faster build tool compared to webpack
- **Separate Directories**: Clear separation of concerns
- **No Build Step for API**: Backend remains simple Node.js
- **File-based Storage**: Kept simple approach, no database needed

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Independent Deployment**: Frontend and backend can be deployed separately
2. **Better Performance**: Client-side routing, no page reloads
3. **Modern Development**: HMR, better debugging, modern tooling
4. **Scalability**: Can scale frontend/backend independently
5. **API Reusability**: Backend API can be used by other clients

### Recent Improvements (January 2025)

#### Test Results Management
- Created `Results.vue` component with comprehensive test result viewing
- Added backend `results.js` route for managing test execution history
- Implemented atomic file writes to prevent data corruption
- Added automatic cleanup of corrupted result files
- Results include detailed assertions, response data, and execution times

#### Default Collection Feature
- Added `settings.js` route to manage application preferences
- Implemented star button in Collections view to set default
- Runner auto-selects default collection on page load
- Visual indicators show which collection is set as default

#### Clone Functionality
- Added clone endpoints to both collections and environments routes
- One-click cloning with automatic renaming (" - Copy" suffix)
- Generates new unique IDs to prevent conflicts
- Useful for creating variations and templates

#### SSE Improvements
- Fixed connection reset issues by improving header setup
- Added heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive
- Improved error handling with proper cleanup
- Better buffering for chunked SSE data

#### UI Enhancements
- Added "Manage Environments" button to home page
- Implemented tooltips on all action buttons
- Improved button grouping with better visual hierarchy
- Enhanced feedback messages for all operations

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Results Storage**
   - Results saved as JSON files in `backend/results/` directory
   - Each result has unique ID with timestamp
   - Includes full execution details from Newman
   - Atomic writes prevent partial file corruption

2. **Settings Management**
   - Settings stored in `backend/settings.json`
   - Auto-created if missing with sensible defaults
   - Currently supports default collection preference
   - Extensible for future settings

3. **Clone Implementation**
   - Reads source file, modifies metadata
   - Creates new file with unique timestamp
   - Preserves all test data and configurations
   - Returns new filename for immediate use

### Next Steps
1. Add batch operations (delete multiple, export selected)
2. Implement test result comparison feature
3. Add collection/environment templates library
4. Create test scheduling with cron jobs
5. Add export options for results (PDF, CSV, HTML)
