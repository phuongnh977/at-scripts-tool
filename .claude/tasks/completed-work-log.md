## Review Section

### Latest Changes Summary (SPA Migration)
- **Separated Frontend/Backend Architecture**
  - Created standalone Vue 3 SPA in `frontend/` directory
  - Moved all backend code to `backend/` directory
  - Removed EJS templating, converted to pure REST API

- **Frontend Implementation**
  - Set up Vue 3 with Vite for fast development
  - Implemented Vue Router for client-side routing
  - Created service layer for API communication
  - Migrated all views to Vue components
  - Configured proxy for development

- **Backend Changes**
  - Removed all view rendering code
  - Focused on REST API endpoints only
  - Added health check endpoint
  - Improved error handling

- **Development Experience**
  - Added concurrent running of frontend/backend
  - Separate package.json for better dependency management
  - Hot module replacement for frontend development

### Technical Decisions
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: More flexible and TypeScript-ready
- **Vite**: Faster build tool compared to webpack
- **Separate Directories**: Clear separation of concerns
- **No Build Step for API**: Backend remains simple Node.js
- **File-based Storage**: Kept simple approach, no database needed

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Independent Deployment**: Frontend and backend can be deployed separately
2. **Better Performance**: Client-side routing, no page reloads
3. **Modern Development**: HMR, better debugging, modern tooling
4. **Scalability**: Can scale frontend/backend independently
5. **API Reusability**: Backend API can be used by other clients

### Next Steps
1. Test the new SPA architecture thoroughly
2. Consider adding state management with Pinia for complex features
3. Implement progressive web app (PWA) features
4. Add comprehensive error boundaries
5. Consider TypeScript migration for better type safety
